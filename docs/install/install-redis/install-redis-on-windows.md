Valkey is not officially supported on Windows. However, you can install Valkey on Windows for development by following the instructions below.

To install Valkey on Windows, you'll first need to enable [WSL2](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) (Windows Subsystem for Linux). WSL2 lets you run Linux binaries natively on Windows. For this method to work, you'll need to be running Windows 10 version 2004 and higher or Windows 11.

## Install or enable WSL2

Microsoft provides [detailed instructions for installing WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install). Follow these instructions, and take note of the default Linux distribution it installs. This guide assumes Ubuntu.

## Install Valkey

You can build Valkey from source or use a docker container.

This section needs to be improved. Thanks for your patience.
