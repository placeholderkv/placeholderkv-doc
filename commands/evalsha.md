Evaluate a script from the server's cache by its SHA1 digest.

The server caches scripts by using the `SCRIPT LOAD` command.
The command is otherwise identical to `EVAL`.

Please refer to the [Valkey Programmability](../topics/programmability.md) and [Introduction to Eval Scripts](../topics/eval-intro.md) for more information about Lua scripts.
